# General Neetcode Intro

I am a very visual learner as such I am creating this tutorial for people like me that understand things with images.

This is based off the neetcode list which is a very detailed compilation of 150 problems which covers virtually all aspects of algorithms.

it is a very well thought out work and I complement the creator Ali Malik on the wonderful job of freely creating this course and sharing it.
