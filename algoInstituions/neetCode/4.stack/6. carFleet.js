/**
 * Video Notes:
 * One common misconception is that this solutions just come to some people naturally
 * it does not. In other to understand the solution you have to have worked on a similar 
 * problem before the questions are not intuitive. When you see someone working at the 
 * solution very casually and explaining them like childs play you tend to gloss over 
 * thhe years of hard work it took to get that level of mastery. That is why when starting out 
 * especially if you lack a maths background you must right out the backtracking problems.
 * There are cetain pillars that are just assumed you understand before the solution of backtracking
 * is explained, How
 * 1. double recursion work
 * 2. the logic behind the constraines
