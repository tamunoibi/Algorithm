   -  So many lessons I have learnt on this wonderful adventure callled life. I would share two of the most important once
        a. Some of the most beautiful thigs come from the darkest and blackest moments. 
           When things are falling apart it can be very scary and heart breaking. 
           During those moments you can feel lost and sad but I have learnt to find the lessons from those moments.
           For example a near death experiennce 
           teaches you the importance of life. A failure teaches you the need to be disciplined, committed, dilligent and hardworking. 
           A lost oppurtunity open the path to an even better oppurtunity. Do not be too hung up on how things most be embrace the twists and turns of life with a view to fidning the silver linnning

        b. I have learnt and am learning that part of the problem is taking life too seriously. Didn't get the 
           Job. So? Fauled the test, and then? Learn to laugh at your failures and mistakes. You are dying anyway. 
         


        c. Expectations. The best of us is a human being to have little or no expectations from people
          and do not be moved by the actions or inactions of people. Just be patient and tolerant with people and their actions 


       d. thigns worth building take perseference, time dedication patientce. Relentlessness after multiple setbbacks and failures. A willingness to make mistakes learn from them
        keep going. 


       e. You are young and beautiful take lots and lots of pictures. You would not be this age twice 
       and the only tangible thing you would have would bbe those pictures
