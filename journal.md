11. LESSONS I HAVE LEARNED
............................................................

So many lessons I have learnt on this wonderful adventure callled life. I would share two of the most important once
        a. Some of the most beautiful thigs come from the darkest and blackest moments. 
           When things are falling apart it can be very scary and heart breaking. 
           During those moments you can feel lost and sad but I have learnt to find the lessons from those moments.
           For example a near death experiennce 
           teaches you the importance of life. A failure teaches you the need to be disciplined, committed, dilligent and hardworking. 
           A lost oppurtunity open the path to an even better oppurtunity. Do not be too hung up on how things most be embrace the twists and turns of life with a view to fidning the silver linnning

        b. I have learnt and am learning that part of the problem is taking life too seriously. Didn't get the 
           Job. So? Fauled the test, and then? Learn to laugh at your failures and mistakes. You are dying anyway. 
         


        c. Expectations. The best of us is a human being to have little or no expectations from people
          and do not be moved by the actions or inactions of people. Just be patient and tolerant with people and their actions 


       d. thigns worth building take perseference, time dedication patientce. Relentlessness after multiple setbbacks and failures. A willingness to make mistakes learn from them
        keep going. 


       e. You are young and beautiful take lots and lots of pictures. You would not be this age twice 
       and the only tangible thing you would have would bbe those pictures


       f. Clean space affects my mind. Working in a deep cleaned house makes my thoughts clearer


       g. Where your attention goes your life force goes. 
         If you want to be hot, sexy all your attention must be focused on that.
         If you want to be working at a great company, sharing your work online making millions your attention must be focused on that. 
         To master your life control your attention if you want to master your life you have to master your mind, and to master your mind you have to master your attention. Where your attention goes your life goes. Instead of looking at the things that you do not like in your life focus your attention onn where you want to go and where you would rather be 


       h. how to wait while you archieve things(example weight loss, carrear growth, content growth). Don't be looking at the thing you wish to archieve make sure you have a specified goal broken into maybe 2week sprints, time frame and actions  for each day. All your focus should be on those actions. You could track your goals by having 2week sprints all your all focus should be on  of consitency for those 14 days. After about 4 sprints you are bound to see tremendious progress from focusing on your actions than on your goals


12. PASTOR M JEWELRY AND MUM FOOD BUSINESS
.............................................................
Action step
a. To get the quality of things we want and to strategise on how to sell it. Where she would be going and the number of times a week 
b. Go and visit her house
c. Take pictures onnline
d. Use that sis Rachel as her model and other people she sells to 
e. Decide if you would do it at all sef


MUMS FOOD BUSINESS
General thought: except you want to be actively involved you can not really get her to do it. And it would make no difference if there is a flier.

Be more invested in mummy's business create a catalogue for her.
The things she sells (snail, crayfish, plantain, potatoe, dry fish, palm oil, ogbonnno, )
Right now is a perfect time to bring in plantain and sell.
Offer free delivery or delivery at 200 naira on a particular day example 200naira delivery

IDEAS
tutorials
- go a type center and work with someone to apply or meet Peace Mum.
- Have a consistent routine to learn html5, react, node, typescript
- Consistently go to the library in the morning to work on tutorial
- I am focused exculsively on learning css.
 When I am done with that then react, then node or should I do small of each? Ans focus on one for 2weeks
- Algorithms: I make sure to solve freecodecamp questions they are easy but help with the fundamentals, I am also learning neetcode as that is a lot of complex algorithims that would help me.
- Search how to implement a proper review strategy:
   I should review algorithims by having a pattern to go over conepts I have studied. What I want is to review difficult concepts. I want some form of repractice of algorithims. The challenge is how to know the algorithims I am to practice? what if I enter it into a flash card that would remind me daily. No. Sounds like exactly what I would not do. What if I write out the some key patterns like recursion, binary tree and add them in my review notes. or just keep practicing with time it would stick


B. Fun and recreation
