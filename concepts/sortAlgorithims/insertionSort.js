  /**Important Concepts to understand insertion Sort
   * 1. understand how swap works with computers, and Why we need to save a temp variable
   * 2. Understand how to loop from the second item to the last item. Extend to loop from the third item to second to the last item
   * 3. Understand how why the last swap is necessary
   * 4. Understand why in the last lin we still had to do 1arr[j + 1] = arr[j];` why are we adding j +1
   * 5. Understand the time complexity of the algo
   * 6. Common mistakes I make and why they are wrong
   * 7. How to switch the items to sort in descending order
   * 8. The while loop. Why we need to need multiple stop conditions, why we need a variable to decrement

       * the proper thing is:   key < arr[j]
       *  For example given the array: [3, 8, 2, 1<index 3>]
       *   by the time we are on index 3 the array would be look like this [2, 3, 8, 1]
       *     inside the while loop  we are comparing:
       *        1 V. 8
       *        1 V. 3
       *        1 V. 2
       * I always mix up this check and , I do: arr[j + 1] < arr[j]
       *
       *  this is wrong because the comparison is not between the index we are and the  subsequent item before it.
       *  but rather between the index we are inz(that is the saved item) and each  item that came before it
       *  For example given the array: [3, 8, 2, 1]
       *   by the time we are on index 3 the array would be [2, 3, 8, 1]
       *    when on the for loop is dealing with the letter 1, inside the while loop it means I am comparing
       *        1 V. 8
       *        8 V. 3
       *        3 V. 2
