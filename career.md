findings 
- I need training on the things I am working on, or if I take on stuff that is 
above my kowledge grade I need additional support from someone that is well rounded in the thhing
- I prefer going to the office instead of working from home although let the office not be too far from me. I enjoyed going to hng it was a trekkable distance but at most 1car away from me. I did not enjoy sycamore it was 3cars away from me. Think about it I am motion sensitive so the movement might not be helping me sha
- I like working if I enjoy my colleagues that we work together on the project
- i have constantly being taken jobs I have no qualifiation for out of desperation and I constnatly got my teeth fed to me
- i need to speciallise and get training in a single area I am thinking react native this jumping from pillar to post is not it
- I did what I could with the resources and knowledge available to me
- If it is possible try to break down your task and how you plan to go about it
