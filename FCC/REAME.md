# Introduction
This files have solutions to the Freecodecamp algorithim problems

## Why did I choose Freecodecamp algorithm?
1. I noticed that it covers a lot of the common algorithms to know for interviews.
2. Their are a lot of great youTube videos explaining the solutions to the problems so it is very beginner friendly.

## How the algorithm is 
Each algorithm is has .md file that explains the question and the solutions
